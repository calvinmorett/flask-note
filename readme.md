This was created to allow me to create an advice book using a parataxis writing style.

Parataxis is a literary technique where the author uses short, simple sentences and clauses to convey meaning and ideas.
These sentences and clauses are often juxtaposed or placed side by side, rather than being connected by conjunctions or other transitional words.
