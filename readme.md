This was created to allow me to create an advice book using a parataxis writing style.

Parataxis is a literary technique where the author uses short, simple sentences and clauses to convey meaning and ideas.
These sentences and clauses are often juxtaposed or placed side by side, rather than being connected by conjunctions or other transitional words.

e.g. From the book, `The Book of Five Rings` by `Miyamoto Musashi`
The Book of Earth ends with nine basic principles – the "ground" upon which the samurai must rely. The principles are:
- "Do not think dishonestly."
- "The Way is in training."
- "Become acquainted with every art."
- "Know the Ways of all professions."
- "Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters."
- "Develop an intuitive judgement and understanding for everything."
- "Perceive those things which cannot be seen."
- "Pay attention even to trifles."
- "Do nothing which is of no use."
